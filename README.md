# Collapse By Name v1.0

A script for 3dsMax to merge all objects in the scene with the same name.

To install, edit the included MaxScript file `run_collapseByName.ms` to be the path to your copy of `collapseByName.py`
Then simply run the MaxScript once in 3dsMax.  From then on, CollapseByName will be available in your
Customize User Interface menu, under jScripts.

To use the script, add it to a toolbar or menu and run it in the scene you wish to collapse.
Progress will be output to the Max listener, and may take some time for scenes with very large
numbers of objects.
